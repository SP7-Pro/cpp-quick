# Preprocesser Directives 
Imagine that you want to eat blueberries, but sadly, blueberries don't grow in your region. Instead of just wishing, you can import them from other regions and eat them happily.
There's a fair reason for giving the above example.
Preprocesser Directives are instructions given to compiler's preprocesser. You probably didn't understood the sentence you just read, but I'll explain that right now.
Focus on the blueberries example. If you want to eat them, but they don't grow in your region, you have to import them. Similarly, compiler's preprocesser can do certain tasks, that may be required for your program to fucntion properly.
And preprocesser directives are just the instructions you give to it.
## Writing Code
Now that you have understood concept of preprocesser directives, we can focus on using them in our code.
All the preprocesser directives begin with '#'. This is the convention used for them in C++.
There are quite a few preprocesser directives, but for this lesson, we'll focus on 3 of them only.
