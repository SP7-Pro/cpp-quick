# Getting Started
## Introduction 
Getting started can be the most challenging point of learning a very new concept, after some time, you'll progress further and the concepts will be a piece of cake.
## Installing an IDE
**IDE stand for integrated development environment.** It is what developers use to edit and debug their code. Code Editors can be used too, But they aren't as feature-rich as an IDE. Also if your program ran into a critical error, IDEs can assist you greatly in debugging, making the devlopement process way faster.
The first step is to choose the IDE that you want to use. Some of the well-known ones are Microsoft Visual Studio, Code::Blocks, Eclipse Kepler, Orwell C/C++ Dev and Codelite.
This series does not teach you to install and configure them. Instead, you'ld follow the instructions provided on webpages of the IDE you're using. I'll link the downloads to the IDEs :
- [Microsoft Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) 
- [Code::Blocks](https://www.codeblocks.org/downloads/)
- [Eclipse Kepler](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/release/kepler/sr2/eclipse-ide-cc-developers)
